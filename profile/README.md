# Differential Labs

AI and analytics advisory for the casino industry.

Differential Labs is the largest analytics consultancy dedicated exclusively to the gaming industry. We partner with casino operators globally to implement AI-driven solutions across marketing, fraud prevention, reinvestment optimization, pricing, yield management, and hotel performance. Our team has delivered initiatives for two-thirds of the world's largest gaming companies.

We are casino analysts first. Technology is only valuable when it drives measurable results — so our work doesn't stop at dashboards or slides. We embed AI into decision-making and create strategies that deliver lasting, trackable impact.

## What We Do

- **Marketing** — Player-level campaign optimization using a library of 40+ shelf campaigns, each designed to change a specific player behavior. Typical engagements drive 20%+ incremental profit lift.
- **Reinvestment & Efficiency** — Right-sizing reinvestment spend without sacrificing profit, typically reducing reinvestment by 3–6 percentage points.
- **Fraud & Advantage Play** — Analytical and AI tools to identify fraud and advantage play that suppress win rates.
- **Floor & RTP Optimization** — Data-driven casino product and RTP strategy.
- **GenAI** — Casino-specific large language models built on top of proprietary data.
